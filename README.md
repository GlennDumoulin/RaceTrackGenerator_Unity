# Race Track Generator

## Introduction

I want to make a race track generator in Unity. To do this I will use algorithms like **Random walk** and **Perlin noise**. The *random walk* will be used to generate *points in space where the track should pass*. The *perlin noise* will be used to generate *the terrain for the track*.

For the track itself I'm not yet sure if I will use a **predifined set of blocks** or a **spline**.

The user should also have **control** over the track:

 - What **type** of track? (*fast-paced, technical,...*)
 - Should the track **loop**?
 - How strong is the **relief** on the track?
